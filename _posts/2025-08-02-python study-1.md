### ✅ **Knowledge Review**

#### 🐍 Benefits of Python

- Easy to read and write
- Used in web dev, data science, automation, AI, etc.
- Large community and many libraries

#### 🆚 Python vs Other Languages

- Simpler syntax than Java/C++
- Interpreted (runs line by line)
- Great for beginners

#### 🌐 How Knowing One Language Helps

- Programming logic is similar across languages (loops, functions, variables)
- Once you understand the basics, it's easier to learn others (e.g., JavaScript, Java)

#### ⚙️ What is Scripting?

- Writing code to automate tasks (e.g., rename files, process data)

### ✅ **Terms to Know**

| Term                     | Definition                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Computer program**     | A set of instructions to perform a task    |
| **Programming language** | Language used to write code (e.g., Python) |
| **Syntax**               | Rules for how code must be written         |
| **Semantics**            | The *meaning* behind the code              |
| **Logic errors**         | Code runs but gives the wrong result       |
| **Script**               | A small program, usually for automation    |
| **Automation**           | Using code to do tasks without human input |
| **Function**             | A reusable block of code, like `print()`   |

------

### ✅ **Coding Skills to Practice**

#### 🧵 Skill 1: Use `print()`

```python
print("I love Python!")
print(360)
print(32 * 45)

# With variables
x = 10
print(x)
```

#### 🧮 Skill 2: Arithmetic Operators

```python
print(3 * 8 / 2 + 5 - 1)

# Exponents
print(4 ** 6)  # 4 to the 6th power
print(4 ** 2)  # Square
print(4 ** 3)  # Cube
print(4 ** 0.5)  # Square root
```

#### 🧠 Skill 3: Variables and Arithmetic

```python
years = 10
weeks_in_a_year = 52
weeks_in_a_decade = years * weeks_in_a_year
print(weeks_in_a_decade)
```

------

### ❗ Reminder: **Syntax Is Everything**

Even one tiny mistake causes an error. Check for:

- 📝 Misspelled words
- 🔠 Wrong case (e.g., `Print` vs `print`)
- ❌ Missing colons (`:`)
- 👎 Unmatched parentheses `()`, brackets `[]`, or braces `{}`
- 🔤 Wrong quotes (mixing `“ ”` instead of `" "`)

------

### 🧪 Example Errors and Fixes

| Mistake         | Correction                               |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `print("Hello'` | `print("Hello")`                         |
| `Print("hi")`   | `print("hi")`                            |
| `x = 3 y = 4`   | `x = 3; y = 4` or put each on a new line |
| `print(2 **)`   | `print(2 ** 3)`                          |
