### 1. **Install Git**
First, ensure that **Git** is installed on the new PC. You can install it by downloading from the official site or using your system’s package manager.

- **Windows**: [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- **Linux**:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install git
    ```

- **macOS** (via Homebrew):

    ```bash
    brew install git
    ```

### 2. **Configure Git with Your GitHub Account**
Once Git is installed, configure it to use your GitHub account by setting your **username** and **email**:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your GitHub Username"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
```

### 3. **Set Up Authentication**
There are two main ways to authenticate your GitHub account on a new PC:

#### Option 1: **SSH Key Authentication**

1. **Create a New SSH Key** on the new PC (if you haven't already done so):

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your-email@example.com"
    ```

    Follow the prompts and use the default location (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`).

2. **Add the SSH Key to the SSH Agent**:

    Start the SSH agent:

    ```bash
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ```

    Add the SSH private key to the agent:

    ```bash
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ```

3. **Add the SSH Key to GitHub**:

    Copy the public key to your clipboard:

    ```bash
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    ```

    Then, log into your GitHub account and go to **Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key**, paste the key, and give it a recognizable title (e.g., “New PC”).

4. **Test the Connection**:

    ```bash
    ssh -T git@github.com
    ```

    If everything is set up correctly, you'll see a message like:

    ```
    Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
    ```

#### Option 2: **Personal Access Token (PAT) Authentication**

1. **Generate a Personal Access Token**:

    - Go to **GitHub > Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens**.
    - Click **Generate new token** and choose the necessary permissions (usually, `repo` scope is enough).
    - Save the generated token somewhere safe.

2. **Use the Token in Git**:

    When you clone a repo or push changes, Git will prompt you for your username and password. Use your **GitHub username** as the username and **the token** as the password.

### 4. **Clone or Work with Repositories**
Once your authentication method is set up, you can clone your repositories:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git   # For SSH
# or
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git  # For HTTPS with PAT
```

You’re now ready to use your GitHub account on a new PC! Let me know if you need further clarification on any steps.
