I’m Ivan Arias, a recent Cybersecurity and Web Development graduate.

Before transitioning into this field, I dedicated over a decade to working as a Geological Engineer, specializing in identifying and assessing oil and gas reserves and solving complex problems in high-pressure environments.

My shift into cybersecurity and web development is driven by a deep passion for technology and the growing need to protect information and systems.

I’ve found that my critical thinking and problem-solving skills, honed during my engineering career, are ideally suited to tackling the complex challenges of cybersecurity.

I excel in collaborating with diverse teams, where varied perspectives lead to innovative solutions.

My strengths include analytical thinking, creative problem-solving, attention to detail, and an ability to adapt to new challenges and consistently deliver high-quality work under tight deadlines.

I’m currently exploring opportunities as a Cybersecurity Analyst or Web Developer. In these roles, I could apply my technical skills to build robust security systems that safeguard organizations from cyber threats while expanding my expertise in the field.
