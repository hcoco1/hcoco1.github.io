To create a new SSH key for GitHub on a new device without affecting your other SSH keys, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Check for Existing SSH Keys

First, check if you have any existing SSH keys on your new device:

```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

This will list any existing SSH keys, typically named `id_rsa`, `id_ecdsa`, or `id_ed25519`. 

### Step 2: Generate a New SSH Key

Generate a new SSH key with a custom name to avoid overwriting existing keys:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

* Replace `"your_email@example.com"` with your GitHub email address.
* When prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key", choose a unique name, such as `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github`:

```bash
Enter a file in which to save the key (/home/your_username/.ssh/id_ed25519): /home/your_username/.ssh/id_ed25519_github
```

### Step 3: Add the New SSH Key to the SSH Agent

To use the new key, you need to add it to the SSH agent:

1. **Start the SSH agent**:

   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ```

2. **Add your new key to the SSH agent**:

   ```bash
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github
   ```

### Step 4: Add the SSH Key to Your GitHub Account

Copy the new SSH key to your clipboard:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github.pub
```

Then, follow these steps:

1. **Go to GitHub** and log in.
2. **Navigate to** `Settings` > `SSH and GPG keys`.
3. **Click on** `New SSH key`.
4. **Paste** your new SSH key and give it a title (e.g., "My New Device").
5. **Click** `Add SSH key`.

### Step 5: Configure SSH to Use the Correct Key

If you have multiple SSH keys, you can configure SSH to use the correct key for GitHub by editing the `~/.ssh/config` file:

```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
```

Add the following configuration:

```bash
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github
```

This ensures that your new key is used when connecting to GitHub.

### Step 6: Test the SSH Connection

Finally, test the SSH connection to GitHub:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see a message like:

```bash
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```
