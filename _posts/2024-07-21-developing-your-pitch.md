An elevator pitch is your short (30-60 second) professional introduction. A prepared elevator pitch will help you start a conversation with potential employers, faculty members, alumni and others. (Developing Your Elevator Pitch, n.d.)


### Why you need an elevator pitch

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 70% of all jobs are found through networking. By building authentic relationships with professionals, over time you can uncover job opportunities that might not be posted, or possibly create an opportunity that did not previously exist.

By engaging in networking activities, it allows you to raise awareness of “your personal brand” by meeting other professionals and sharing your abilities, skills and background. In turn when people in your network hear about potential opportunities, they may immediately think of you.

Your elevator pitch should:

1. Communicate your personal brand and what you want to be known for

2. Convey your unique selling points

3. Answer the questions “Tell me about yourself’ “What do you do?” and “What are you interested in doing next?

(Developing Your Elevator Pitch, n.d.).

### Before you create your pitch, first think about:

- What makes you unique?
- What are you seeking?
- What can you offer?
- What do you want a person to remember about you?

(Developing Your Elevator Pitch, n.d.).

### Create your pitch in five steps

1. Spend some time thinking about and writing down your top work and school experiences using the STAR Method (Situation, Task, Action and Result). Choose one one-to-two experiences you want to pitch.
2. Shorten each story to a sentence or two focusing on your actions and the results of those actions.
3. Analyze the common themes:
    - What are you good at?
    - What do you like doing?
    - Are you a problem solver, analytical thinker, effective communicator, innovator, etc?
4. Tailoring your pitch for the audience/person you are speaking to and the setting you are in
5. Put it together and make it conversational. Add a question to the end of your description or offer to help someone with something they are working on.

## What is a "Pitch?"

A pitch is an introduction. It's the response you give when someone says, "Tell me about yourself."
- It's a greeting - how you introduce yourself.
- It represents your "brand" - the reputation you create when networking with others.
- It's your "hook" that describes the experiences, skills, and talents that are unique to you.

## Why is a Pitch Important?

Your pitch should be specific, short, sweet, and flexible. Think of your pitch like a rubber band. You will stretch and condense it as needed for whatever situation you find yourself in.
- **Career Fair?** Quick pitch.
- **Networking event?** Use it to create conversation.
- **First in-person interview?** Get more specific.
- **With your Career Success Coach?** Practice!

It's important to practice your pitch so that you are ready in all of the following settings and experiences:
- **Technical Networking Events**
- **Interviews**
- **Coffee Chats**
- **Informational Sessions**
- **Personal Branding** (LinkedIn + Portfolio Website Summary)
- **Meeting People in General**

## Think of Your Pitch as a Transferable [Power] Skill!

Delivering a strong pitch can aid in showcasing your effective communication skills, a top transferable skill. Your pitch also allows you to articulate other transferable skills that you possess and have demonstrated in professional environments.

If you've already worked through the Identifying Your Transferable Skills lesson, then you know what your skills superpowers are! (If you haven't reviewed the lesson, now is a great time to do so!)

Transferable skills are habits that shape how you work autonomously, and in collaboration with others. According to Indeed, top transferable skills include:

- **Integrity**
- **Dependability**
- **Effective communication**
- **Open-mindedness**
- **Teamwork**
- **Creativity**
- **Problem-solving**
- **Critical thinking**
- **Adaptability**
- **Organization**
- **Willingness to learn**
- **Empathy**

Weaving these types of skills into your pitch is a great way to demonstrate your top transferable skills.
